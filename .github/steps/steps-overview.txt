Step 1 - Create a workflow file:
  • Introduces the idea of GitHub Actions workflows and explains that they live in the .github/workflows directory.
  • Guides you to create a new branch named "welcome-workflow" and add a starter welcome.yml workflow triggered by pull_request events.

Step 2 - Add a job to the workflow file:
  • Explains that jobs group related steps and run on a specified runner.
  • Has you extend welcome.yml by adding a jobs section with a single welcome job that runs on ubuntu-latest.

Step 3 - Add a step to the workflow job:
  • Describes how steps run inside a job and can invoke actions or shell commands.
  • Instructs you to add a step that uses the GitHub CLI to comment on the pull request, including required environment variables.

Step 4 - Trigger the workflow:
  • Covers how workflows appear in the Actions tab and how pull_request events trigger them.
  • Directs you to open a pull request from welcome-workflow to main so the workflow posts its welcome comment, and to review the run details.

Step 5 - Merge and experiment:
  • Explains that workflows become active for the whole repository once merged into the default branch.
  • Tells you to merge the pull request and optionally test the workflow again by opening another pull request.

Finish - Review accomplishments:
  • Celebrates completing the exercise and summarizes what you accomplished across the steps.
  • Suggests additional resources for continuing to learn about GitHub Actions.
