# Hello GitHub Actions Skill üéâ

You completed GitHub Skills' **Hello GitHub Actions** course‚Äînice work! This repository captures the finished state of the exercise so you (or anyone else) can revisit what a working solution looks like.

## What you built

| Path | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/workflows/welcome.yml` | The learner-authored workflow. It posts a friendly comment to every newly opened pull request using the `gh` CLI and the automatically provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`. |
| `.github/workflows/0-start-exercise.yml` ‚Üí `.github/workflows/5-step.yml` | A scaffold of facilitator workflows that drive the tutorial: they open the guidance issue, watch your progress, unlock each next challenge, and wrap up the course once the pull request is merged. |
| `.github/steps/*.md` | The step-by-step instructions the bot posts back to you. Each Markdown file explains a core Actions concept and includes the copy-pasteable YAML used in the checks above. |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | Keeps the Actions used in this repository up to date on a monthly cadence. |
| `README.md` | This recap‚Äîshare it with teammates who want a quick tour of the finished project. |

## How the automation flows

1. **Step 0** kicks off when the repository is initialized. It opens your guidance issue, publishes the first instructions, and enables the Step 1 validator.
2. **Steps 1‚Äì3** monitor pushes to your working branch. They confirm the workflow file exists, validate each addition (triggers, jobs, and steps), and post encouragement as you go.
3. **Step 4** waits for you to open a pull request into `main`, then guides you through reviewing and merging your changes.
4. **Step 5** celebrates the merge, posts the retrospective summary from `x-review.md`, and calls the shared ‚Äúfinish exercise‚Äù workflow.

All of these facilitator workflows are reusable building blocks from [`skills/exercise-toolkit`](https://github.com/skills/exercise-toolkit), so you can peek at those references to see how GitHub orchestrates multi-step learning experiences.
